Hi! Iâ€™m Jiajun Fan, a master student of [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). I have been starving for intelligent agents that can achieve human-level or even superhuman intelligence. I always believe that machine learning and robotics can be used to improve the human life and change our future!

## Research Area

I'm working on [**Reinforcement Learning**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning), which I believe is the key to achieving [**Artificial General Intelligence**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence). I currently focus on efficient learning in model-free RL algorithms. Although I am still a beginner in this field, I hope to devote all my life to it.

If you are interested in my work or sharing the same research interest/ideals, welcome to contact me through [my email](mailto:fanjj21@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn) or [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jiuajunfan-Thu).

## My Background and History

I am currently pursing a master's degree in Computer Science and Technology in the [Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) of [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). I have received my bachelor's degree in the [College of Artificial Intelligence](https://aien.nankai.edu.cn/) at [Nankai University](https://en.nankai.edu.cn/).
