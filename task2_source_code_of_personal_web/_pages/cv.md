Education
======
* B.S. in Intelligent Science and Technology, Nankai University, 2017-2021
* M.S. in Electronic Information (Computer Science), Tsinghua University, 2021-2024 (expected)

Academic Experience
======
* $R \& D$ Intern: Research on High-efficiency Reinforcement Learning Algorithm	Sep 2020 - Jun 2021
  * Extended the basic paradigm of RL called the **Generalized Policy Iteration (GPI)** into a more generalized version, which is called the **Generalized Data Distribution Iteration (GDI)**.
  * **Unified massive RL algorithms into the GDI paradigm,** which can be considered as one of the special cases of GDI.
  * Provided theoretical proof of why GDI is better than GPI and how it works.
  * My work has achieved SOTA in Atari57 and broken through massive human world records, which also outperformed Agent57.
  * Published a paper called  **”GDI: Rethinking What Makes Reinforcement Learning Different From Supervised Learning”**.  In addition, I have invented more than **9 national patents.**
  * Supervisor: Changnan Xiao 
* $R \& D$ Intern: Research on Model-free Reinforcement Learning Algorithm	Sep 2020 - Jun 2021
  * Proposed **a unified framework of model-free reinforcement learning** called **CASA**.
  * Proposed an entropy regularization free mechanism for policy-based reinforcement learning based on bandits.
  * Published two papers called **”CASA: A Bridge Between Gradient of Policy Improvement and Policy Evaluation”** and **”An Entropy Regularization Free Mechanism for Policy-based Reinforcement Learning”**.  Additionally, I have published several patents.
  * Supervisor: Changnan Xiao 
* $R \& D$​ Intern: Research on Model-based Reinforcement Learning Algorithm	Apr 2020 - Sep 2020
  * Proposed a novel method to improve the algorithm learning framework and test the algorithm performance on the **MuJoCo simulation environment**.
  * Published a paper called **”Critic PI2: Master Continuous Planning via Policy Improvement with Path Integrals and Deep Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning”**.
  * Supervisor: Xian Guo
* $R \& D$ Intern: Research on Model-based Reinforcement Learning Algorithm	Sep 2018 - Jul 2019
  * Proposed a solution for the entire project and a finite state machine diagram.
  * Implemented autonomous navigation and RRT path planning related algorithms based on ROS.
  * Project results have been presented in the **2019 ROBOCUP Sydney World Finals**.
  * Supervisor: JeffreyTooChuan
