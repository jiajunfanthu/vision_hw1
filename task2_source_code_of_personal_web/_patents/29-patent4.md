permalink: /patent/2021/06/29-patent4
excerpt: 'The present disclosure relates to a training method, device, medium, and electronic equipment of a deep reinforcement learning model. The method includes: acquiring an interaction sequence generated by the interaction between the deep reinforcement learning model and a virtual environment. The interaction sequence includes a plurality of sampling data; A sampling data, determine the advantage function value of the advantage function of the deep reinforcement learning model corresponding to the environmental state in the sample data, and the advantage expectation of the advantage function value under the decision strategy corresponding to the sampling data, where the decision strategy is based on the advantage function Determined by the strategy family function formed by multiple associated strategy parameters in the deep reinforcement learning model; for each sampled data, according to the sampled data, the corresponding advantage function value, the advantage expectation, and the state value of the deep reinforcement learning model Function, determine the action value; determine the updated gradient information of the action value function based on the action value; update the deep reinforcement learning model according to the updated gradient information.
