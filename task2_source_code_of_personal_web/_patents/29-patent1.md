excerpt: 'The present disclosure relates to a method, a device, a deep reinforcement learning framework, a medium, and a device for determining hyperparameters. The method includes: obtaining a target hyperparameter combination of a target model and storing it in each of multiple reference hyperspaces According to the target interaction sample and the reference value space, determine the target score corresponding to each value space in the target hyperspace corresponding to the target hyperparameter combination; according to the target hyperspace For the target score corresponding to each value space of, the target space is determined from multiple value spaces in the target hyperspace; the target value combination corresponding to the target hyperparameter combination is determined according to the target space. Therefore, the target value combination corresponding to the target hyperparameter combination is determined based on the preset number of target interaction samples in each reference value space, which can improve the status of the determined target value combination and the current target model to a certain extent The matching real-time.'
