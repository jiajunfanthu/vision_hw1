permalink: /patent/2021/06/08-patent6
excerpt: 'The present disclosure relates to a method, a device, a deep reinforcement learning framework, a medium, and a device for determining hyperparameters. The method includes: acquiring an interactive sample corresponding to the target hyperparameter under the sampling value of the target hyperparameter of the target model, and the interactive sample It is generated based on the obtained sampling sample corresponding to the sampling value. The interactive sample contains the sampling value and the optimized feature parameters corresponding to the target model; each parameter in the model is determined for multiple parameters used to determine the target hyperparameter The model updates the state value corresponding to the target hyperparameter in the parameter determination model according to the interactive sample; determines the model for each parameter, determines the updated state value corresponding to the target hyperparameter in the model according to the parameter, and selects multiple values The candidate area is determined in the area; the candidate area determined by the model is determined according to each parameter, and the target area is determined; the target value of the target hyperparameter is determined according to the target area, so as to improve the accuracy of the hyperparameter value.'
