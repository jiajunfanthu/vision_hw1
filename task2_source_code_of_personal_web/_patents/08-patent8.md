collection: patents
permalink: /patent/2021/06/08-patent8
excerpt: 'The present disclosure relates to a method, device, framework, medium, and equipment for updating a deep reinforcement learning model. The method includes: acquiring an interaction sequence generated by the interaction between a deep reinforcement learning model and a virtual environment, the interaction sequence including a plurality of sample data , Wherein each of the sample data includes a first state of the virtual environment, a decision action, and the reward value and the first state of the decision action obtained when the virtual environment is in the state corresponding to the first state. Two states; for each sampled data, determine the updated gradient information corresponding to the deep reinforcement learning model according to the target sampled data corresponding to the sampled data; update the deep reinforcement learning model according to the updated gradient information. As a result, the determined updated gradient information is matched with the actual processing process of the deep reinforcement learning, so as to improve the accuracy and efficiency of updating the deep reinforcement learning model based on the updated gradient information.'
