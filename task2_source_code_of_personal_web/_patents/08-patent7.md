collection: patents
permalink: /patent/2021/06/08-patent7
excerpt: 'The present disclosure relates to a method, a device, a learning framework, a medium, and a device for determining the value of an action. The method includes: acquiring an interaction sequence generated by the interaction between a deep reinforcement learning model and a virtual environment, wherein the interaction sequence includes a plurality of sampling data, Each sampled data includes the environmental state of the environment and the decision-making action corresponding to the environmental state; for each sampled data, determine the advantage function of the deep reinforcement learning model and the advantage function value corresponding to the environmental state in the sampling data, and The advantage expectation of the advantage function value under the decision strategy corresponding to the data, the probability distribution corresponding to the decision strategy is constructed based on the advantage function and the strategy entropy parameter of the deep reinforcement learning model; for each sampled data, according to the sampled data and the corresponding sampled data The advantage function value, the advantage expectation and the state value function of the deep reinforcement learning model determine the action value corresponding to the sampled data and improve the evaluation accuracy of the decision strategy.
