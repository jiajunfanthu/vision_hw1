collection: patents
permalink: /patent/2021/06/29-patent2
excerpt: 'The present disclosure relates to a method, a device, a deep reinforcement learning framework, a medium, and a device for determining hyperparameters. The method includes: obtaining a combination of sampling values corresponding to a target hyperparameter combination of a target model and corresponding to the sampling value combination Sampling samples; generate interactive samples corresponding to the target hyperparameter combination based on the sampled samples; determine the model for each parameter in the multiple parameter determination model used to determine the target hyperparameter combination, and determine the target hyperparameters in the model based on the interactive samples The state value corresponding to the combination is updated; the model is determined for each parameter, the updated state value corresponding to the target hyperparameter combination in the model is determined according to the parameter, and the candidate space is determined from multiple value spaces; the model is determined according to each parameter Determine the target space based on the determined candidate space; determine the target value combination corresponding to the target hyperparameter combination according to the target space, and improve the accuracy of the value of multiple hyperparameters that have an association relationship.'
